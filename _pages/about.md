Â¡Hola! ðŸ‘‹ I'm a **research scientist** at [Google DeepMind](https://deepmind.google) making AI more reliable and trustworthy.

I obtained my PhD at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/)ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­ under the supervision of Pascal Frossard where I focused on the [empirical understanding of deep learning](https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/306613). During my PhD, I interned at [Google Research](https://research.google/) in ZÃ¼rich and visited Philip Torr's lab at the [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/) ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ as part of the [ELLIS PhD Program](https://ellis.eu/projects/a-geometric-look-to-understand-generalization-and-robustness-of-deep-learning). Prior to that, I obtained my MSc. from TU Delft ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡± and my BSc. from Universidad PolitÃ©cnica de Madrid ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸.

**Research interests:** I work in [responsible AI](), developing tools to make models more reliable, fair, safe and universally useful. I am also interested in the [science of deep learning](), with a focus on understanding how editions in the weights affect the behavior of AI systems.

If you're not sure how to to pronounce my name you can watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dN7IJXsh6Q). Here's a quick tip: the double "ll" in Spanish sounds like a "y" and the "u" in "Gui" is silent. So altogether, it's "ghee-YAIR-moh."
